long long ago, there is a girl called Mami, then, she died.

She lived a very happy life and left her brother with a lot of money.

Her brother used this money to build a large memorial for her, but they accidentally made it ugly.

It was so ugly that nobody ever visited it, and her brother was published in the paper for being so bad at design. 
He went to the journalists house to punch him, but then he was struck by lightning and died.
